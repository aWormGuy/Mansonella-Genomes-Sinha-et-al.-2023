# Gene predictions on genomes from Lefoulon et al. 2020
The following filarial genome sequences from Lefoulon et al. 2020 and were available from NCBI, but the corresponding gene annotations for these assemblies were not. Hence, repeat-modeling, repeat-masking and gene annotation using braker2 pipeline was performed on each of these species as described for M. perstans and M. ozzardi.
- Cruorifilaria tuberocauda (Ctub) = GCA_013365365.1
- Dipetalonema caudispina (Dcau) = GCA_013365325.1
- Dirofilaria immitis (Dimm) = GCA_013365355.1
- Litomosoides brasiliensis (Lbra) = GCA_013365375.1 
- Madathamugadia hiepei (Mhie) = GCA_013365335.1

This folder contains the outputs obtained for these genomes.
