# Genomes and annotations for Mansonella perstans and Mansonella ozzardi isolates

The genome assemblies and annotations for M. perstans and M. ozzardi isolates  described in Sinha et al. 2023 (https://doi.org/10.3389/fitd.2023.1139343) are currently at various stages of submission to NCBI and will be available there as soon as they are processed, under the BioProject accessions specified in the article.

In the meanwhile, they are being made available here for quick access. Please note that the genomes and annotations can change slightly after the quality check process implemented by NCBI. Any users are requested to use the final NCBI versions and accessions (when they become available) in their publications.

There are 4 files for each of the 4 isolates: (1) the genome fasta file (2) the gff file with predicted gene models (3) the predicted mRNA fasta file (4) the predicted proteins fasta file.
