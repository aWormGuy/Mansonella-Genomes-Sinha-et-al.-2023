Although the genome sequences for filarial nematodes Cruorifilaria tuberocauda, Dipetalonema caudispina, Dirofilaria immitis, Litomosoides brasiliensis and Madathamugadia hiepei (Lefoulon et al., 2020) were available from NCBI (GenBank accessions GCA_013365365.1, GCA_013365325.1, GCA_013365355.1, GCA_013365375.1 and GCA_013365335.1 respectively). However, the corresponding gene annotations for these assemblies were not available in NCBI. Hence, repeat-modeling, repeat-masking and gene annotation using braker2 pipeline was performed on each of these species as described for M. perstans and M. ozzardi.
This folder contains the scripts used and the outputs obtained for these genomes.
